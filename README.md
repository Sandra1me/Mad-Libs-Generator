# Mad-Libs-Generator

In this project, you will play the Mad Libs game with MATLAB. It is a phrasal template word game in which you have to introduce different words to fill in the blank spaces on a template. Then, the program will print the resultant story.

## Usage

You can run the program from the MadLibs.m file in the editor window or by calling the MadLibs script in your MATLAB console (if you are in the same folder, type the name, if not, write the full directory address). By doing this, it will run the game without GUI.

If you don't have MATLAB, install the app by running the MyAppInstaller_mcr.exe file to install the game. Then, run the installed file.

After starting it, the program will ask you to insert different words, and in the end, it will print a story with what you inserted.
